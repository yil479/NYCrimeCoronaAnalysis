# Data Analysis: Coronavirus and Crimes at New York City
In this analysis we hope to discover a relationship between the coronavirus and crimes in New York City (NYC). We believe that factors due to the coronavirus such as the economic crisis and people staying home may affect the number and type of crimes that occur. Especially, we focus on 2 types of crimes: burglary and robbery. 

Definitions:  
Burglary - entry into a building illegally with intent to commit a crime, especially theft.  
Robbery - the action of taking property unlawfully from a person or place by force or threat of force.

We have 3 reasons why we chose these 2 crimes:  
1. When the economy is declining, burglary and robbery seem to be crimes that are likely to increase
2. There were higher demands for necessity goods, with stores having sold out items, which may also increase the number of cases for burglary and robbery
3. Finally, it is because we are able to collect all of the burglary and robbery cases from March 1st to March 22nd for the years 2018~2020 in NYC from SpotCrime (https://spotcrime.com/ny/new+york).

The analysis we plan to show are the following:
- Difference in the total number of burglary and robbery cases of March 1-22, 2018-2020
- Difference in the daily number of burglary and robbery cases in March 1-22, 2020
- Concentration of the location of burglary and robbery cases

We explain the reasoning behind why we chose these analysis later in each section.

But before the analysis, we preprocess the crime data.
